# Docker

This is my first learning space to learn about docker, and specifically using **docker desktop** for projects at home.

## Day 1 `08/06/2024`
* Went over the `What is a container?` segment in the docker desktop learning senter`
* It's neat that I can see my docker container through the terminal `docker container ls`, I wonder if I can kick it off locally too?
  * `docker run <Container ID>` In docker desktop i sat that it created a new container named "naughty_easey", I'm guessing that this is a randomly generated name. I also see that docker desktop named the images since theyre name and image id are different. Also when I ran my terminal thread was caught on it, so I `ctrl+c` in order to get out, and it also exited the docker container, so it isn't up and running any more.
