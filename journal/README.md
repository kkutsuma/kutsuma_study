This holds any non-subject specific details of what I worked on throughout the day

## Day 1 `08/06/2024`
* Today I mostly spent my time setting up my workspace the way that I wnat it.
* I also was able to spend some time in the docker desktop `Learning Center` and go over some of its' features
  * It's really cool that I already have a html page up and running on my localhost within seconds. I can't wait to start ideation and creating new projects.
