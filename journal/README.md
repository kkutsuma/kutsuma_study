This holds any non-subject specific details of what I worked on throughout the day

## Day 1 `08/06/2024`

* Today I mostly spent my time setting up my workspace the way that I want it.
* I also was able to spend some time in the docker desktop `Learning Center` and go over some of its' features
  * It's really cool that I already have a html page up and running on my localhost within seconds. I can't wait to start ideation and creating new projects.

## Day 2 `08/07/2024`

A bit busy the past couple of days. Mostly able to work on various chores and found some time to study again today.

Lately I've had two ideas for projects, I'm planning by this Sunday, (`08/11/2024`) to work on ideation, and logistics of the project. Here's the premise of the ideas.

### Movement profit dashboard

For wrist watches, the mechanism that keeps time is called a movement. There are many watches out there that will use the same movement, but different accessories and a widely varying price.

The valjoux 7750 is a popular and historic movement. As such we can see watches that range from $1,000-$15,000. As such I want to expose the question, for a given movement what variables for cost can I change, want what will my expected return be. I imagine comparing up to 4 watches with the same movement at the time. With slider bars on each comparison I can control the price of the dial, case, hands, advertisement, brand, overhead (storage, shipping etc). Then given the msrp, & market price what the profit margin is. If i spend a week gathering and cleaning data I can probably pump out a R-shiny dashboard in a day, But I want to challenge myself to make this an interactive site that's connected to my own backend

### Personal Website, journal, resume

This is simple, I just want to create my own website from scratch to host all of my projects, resume, and work that I'm doing. I really don't need it to be interactive at the moment, but there are a couple of technology stacks that I'm interested in since I don't get to work on any `traditional` tech-stacks at work.

Currently learning about docker is part of this journey, but really I want to learn how to connect the front end & back end. What the best methods and more importantly best practices for any given method.

NOTE: I saw this note pop-up about [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#file-storage) and I might need to change my current workspace.
