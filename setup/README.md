### Licenses
This was my first time dealing with choosing a license myself.
[choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) and github's site for [Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) were huge helps in choosing my first license being the [MIT LIcense](/LICENSE)
